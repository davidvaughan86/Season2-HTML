use dotNotation for calling classes with class=''
use # for calling elements by id=''

Positioning

    <img src='./positions.png' width='25%'>

    static - default. not affected by 'left' etc

    relative - positions outside of static. uses 'left' 'right' etc. Will space from content

    absolute - will fixed itself to the non static element. If none will attach to the body and will cover other images in the way

    fixed - similar to absolute but stays fixed to the browser window despite where you are on the code. Best for nav bars sidebars heading menus and footers

    sticky - vuewable when scrolling. Will fix to a spoistiob when user scrolls out of its position.

Media Query
    a condition that happens when something is triggered. Usually the size of the screen.
